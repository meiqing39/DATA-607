## **Approach**

In this assignment, I am using the data set of Coco-Cola (KO) and PepsiCo(PEP) price trends since January 1, 2022. I find this data set interesting as they are both each others main competitors. I will be using the dpylr and zoo R packages to better understand how to use window function for time series for 2 or more separate items , which is a variation of an aggregation function to THE 2 types of window function that will be required for this analysis will be a rolling window for the 6 day moving average and an expanding window for the Year to Data (YTD) average.

## **Process proposal steps:**

(1) **Data Preparation and Sorting:** First, i will sort the data by Ticker and Date which ensure calculations will follow the correct chronological order so that there is no blunder to accurate time-series analysis

(2) **Rolling Window --\> 6 Days Moving Average:** I will group by Ticket only, use rollmean() from zoo package, k=6 for window size, align = "right", and setting any incomplete parts with NA (fill = NA) using values from date and the first 5 days is used for the average.

```{r}

```

(3) **Expanding Window --\> YTD Average:**\
    Group by Ticker and Year, use cummean () - cumulative mean in dyplr package to calculate YTD average.

```{r}

```
