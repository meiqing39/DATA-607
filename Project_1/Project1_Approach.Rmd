## [**Approach**]{.underline}

In this project, we are given a text file with chess tournament results where information has some structure. The goal is to create an R markdown file that generates a .CSV file (that could be for example imported into a SQL database) with the following information for all players:

### *Player’s Name, Player’s State, Total Number of Points, Player’s Pre-Rating, and Average Pre Chess Rating of Opponents*

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="40%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://images.pexels.com/photos/277092/pexels-photo-277092.jpeg")

```

(1) Data Loading: The tournament text file will be posted on Github, which allows me to load the data frame.

(2) Data Tidying: Based on looking at raw tournament txt file, I see that there are some rows of lines and other cells that will need to be cleared up , columns that are not needed for calculation, renaming columns for clarity, rearranging, and changing of characters to integers for easier workaround for this data frame.

(3) Create CSV: With this newly cleaned up version of this table, a csv file will be created and used to analyze the tournament information.
